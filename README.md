# üß† llm-reasoning-papers

This repository tracks and organizes cutting-edge research papers on the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). It focuses on two core areas:

- **Standard Reasoning**: How LLMs perform deductive, inductive, and abstract reasoning tasks.
- **Causal Reasoning**: How LLMs engage in or support causal inference, counterfactual reasoning, and structural causal modeling.

The aim is to curate a structured, regularly updated reading list for researchers, students, and practitioners interested in the evolving reasoning abilities of LLMs.
